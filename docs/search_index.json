and Python\n\nPython is relative new target from Haxe, which sounds cool to know more about.\nAs most target with Haxe, they are poorly documented.\nI hope this will help. If you think so, why not help with contribution to this tutorial site.\nHow will this help me?\nIt will get you started with Python and Haxe.\nHow to setup your project, install externs and how to work with them. This probably will never be a complete documentation but it will help you get started!\nWho is this for?\nFor clever, cool and handsome developers. Duh! :D\nDocumentation goals\nI wanted to make contributing to this documentation as easy as possible.\nThat's why I use Markdown. Developers use it, but is just writing in plain English so everybody can write documentation!\nAnd this documentation hosted on Github, developers favorite place to store code.\nEven if you are not a developer. Don't want to clone everything, you still can change the files on the website (you need account to login in and change the .md files).\nAnd as a final resort, you can leave your comments/suggestions/etc at the bottom of the page via Disqus.\nOpen-sourcing the documentation\nI thought I was the first to try to write documentation and open-sourcing it this way, but other beat me.\nAlthough I was already writing everything with markdown, it looked like a good idea to use Gitbook to \"publish\" it. Writing documentation is like writing a book.\nOther clever developers who had this idea before me:\n\nbabylon js open sourcing the documentation\nbuilding markdown based developer docs\n\nOther resources about writing documentation (Markdown)\n\n13-things-people-hate-about-your-open-source-docs/\nhttps://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs\nhttps://github.com/karthik/markdown_science/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring\nhttps://todaymade.com/blog/markdown-documentation-generator/\n\n"},"level.html":{"url":"level.html","title":"Level of Difficulty","keywords":"","body":"Level of Difficulty\nI thought it would be useful to have some idea what sort of level the examples have here.\nHow to define your level on a specific topic?\n\nBeginner: No knowledge at all of the topic\nBasic: A very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage\nIntermediate: A basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage\nAdvanced: A good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage\nExpert: A perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage\n\nHow does that translate to these examples?\nBeginner\nNo knowledge at all of the topic.\nThese examples start with the simplest code.\nBut I don't think you will have any use of these examples without knowledge of Haxe or JavaScript.\nStart learning the basics of JavaScript and Haxe.\nTo get you start I have a little chapter about learning Haxe.\nBasic\nA very basic knowledge of the topic but no professional usage\n\nIntermediate\nA basic knowledge of the topic but no regular professional usage\n\nAdvanced\nA good knowledge of the topic and a regular professional usage\n\nExpert\nA perfect knowledge of the topic and a daily professional usage\nGo away, you're done.\n\n\n"},"haxe/about.html":{"url":"haxe/about.html","title":"Haxe basics","keywords":"","body":"What is Haxe?\n\nLets get the Wikipedia description first:\n\nHaxe is an open source high-level multi-platform programming language and compiler that can produce applications and source code for many different platforms from a single code-base.\nHaxe includes a set of common functionality that is supported across all platforms, such as numeric data types, text, arrays, binary and some common file formats. Haxe also includes platform-specific API for Adobe Flash, C++, PHP and other languages.\nCode written in the Haxe language can be source-to-source compiled into ActionScript 3 code, JavaScript programs, Java, C# , C++ standalone applications, Python, PHP, Apache CGI, and Node.js server-side applications.\n\nFrom wikipedia\n\nAnd the official description:\n\nHaxe consists of a high-level, open source programming language and a compiler. It allows compilation of programs, written using an ECMAScript-oriented syntax, to multiple target languages. Employing proper abstraction, it is possible to maintain a single code-base which compiles to multiple targets.\nHaxe is strongly typed but the typing system can be subverted where required. Utilizing type information, the Haxe type system can detect errors at compile-time which would only be noticeable at run-time in the target language. Furthermore, type information can be used by the target generators to generate optimized and robust code.\n\nFrom haxe.org - manual\n\nPersonal\nI have though long if I wanted to add a personal note to the \"What is Haxe\" section. And what would it add?\nBut I think it will give context why, or who is using Haxe.\nI was an ActionScript developer, but we can say that language is dead.\nThere is a part of me that could rant about that, but it's easier just to say \"let move on\".\nI originally studied to be a graphic designer. But discovered that I could do animation pretty good.\nI started using Flash as an animator and learned how to program in Flash.  Later in a IDE (SE|PY written in Python if I'm not mistaken).\nI started to experiment with MTASC (which is the Haxe predecessor) because it compiled faster then Flash did.\nThen Nicolas stopped working on MTASC and focused on Haxe. He lost me there, I was to junior-dev to understand what he was doing, and at the time nobody around me was interested in it.\nSomewhere it must have grabbed my attention again! And I using it (for hobby projects) for x years (probably less than 10 years, but more than 5 years)\nFrom a ActionScript background it's not difficult at all to work with Haxe. And I guess the same is for JavaScript developers.\nI love the fact that I have one language and with a little work you can export to different targets.\nI can create a PHP backend without writing PHP (I have to figure out some stuff that you don't have in ActionScript)\nWith Openfl (written on top of Haxe) I can create IOS, Android and html5 applications in a short time.\nI'm focused on JavaScript and NodeJs for the time being but that could change.\n\n"},"haxe/quick-install.html":{"url":"haxe/quick-install.html","title":"Quick install","keywords":"","body":"Quick install\nThis tutorial is for the TL;DR crowd...\nYou just want to get started ... right!\n\nChoose your OS:\n\nOSX\nLinux\nWindows\n\nAt the time of writing, the version is Haxe 3.2.1, but don't let that stop you when that has changed\n\nOSX\nStep 0: You have joined an elite Haxe force!\nYou are cooler then a polar bear!\nStep 1: Install Haxe\nYou can find installers and binaries for Windows, OS X and Linux on http://haxe.org/download/.\n\nDownload\nAnd install\n\nStep 2: Install Editor\nYou need an editor, lets install Visual Studio Code\n\nOn the homepage of Visual Studio Code find the button called \"Download for OSX\" (it right in your face, a big button).\n\nDownload\nAnd install\n\nStep 3: Install VSCode -

If you are a Windows user (and perhaps if you are not), we recommend that you try HaxeDevelop first.\nHaxeDevelop is a great developer IDE with:\n\nintegrated source-control support (svn, git, mercurial)\ntasks/todo, snippets\nplugin support\nXML/HTML/CSS completion\nbuilt-in zen-coding for HTML\n\nHaxe developers prefer HaxeDevelop.\nHaxeDevelop is free and open-source.\nVisual Studio Code\n\nVisual Studio Code Build and debug modern web and cloud applications.

Sublime Text is cross-platform, with support for Windows, Mac and Linux.\nSublime Text does not provide accurate code completion. Nor does it support \"projects\" in the traditional IDE sense. But, yet, Sublime Text is much stronger than a simple text editor, and is a good recommendation for Mac and Linux users.\nSublime Text is free-to-use, with reminders to pay for continued use.\nIntelliJ IDEA\n\nIntelliJ IDEA is primarily marketed as a Java IDE. But it has growing support within the Haxe community, including large teams, such as TiVo. The full edition and the free community edition, support the Haxe plugin, which is not easy to install.

We blend visual tools into the editor so you get the right amount of help when you want it.\nOther Choices\nThere are other code editors to choose from, include vim and up-and-coming Haxe-based editors.

One that is less well-known, but will surely blow your mind, is Haxe. It is one of the earliest languages that target JS (since 2006). It is a statically-typed language with ECMAScript like syntax.\n\nPeter Štefček (Pixel Federation): Open-source Lang.
